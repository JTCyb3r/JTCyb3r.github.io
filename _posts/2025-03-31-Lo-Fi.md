## Introduction  
This is a writeup of the Lo-Fi CTF room, on TryHackMe 

## 🕵️ Reconnaissance
> ### 🛠️ Tools Used
> - **Nmap** → Port scanning  
{:.notice--info}

We start with an Nmap scan of the target

**Command Used:**
```bash
nmap -sV -vv 10.10.73.150  # -sV: Version detection, -vv: Verbose output
```

**Results:**

This reveals an SSH port and a webserver on port 80. Investigating the latter give us the following

It's a webpage, with different categories of music discography
Clicking onto these different categories does something interesting to the url

This shows the URL changing and referencing the respective PHP page for the category


## 🔍 Vulnerability Analysis
Given the changing URL parameters, it indicates the potential of a Local File Inclusion vulnerability. 
LFI is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to execute/access files by manipulating file pathing within a web application. If input isn't sanitised by the application, directory traversal is possible, and so an attacker may be able to access sensitive files they are not inteded to be able to access.

In this case, using Burp Suite to capture a request:
![LoFi Vuln 1](/assets/TryHackMe/Lo-Fi/Lo-Fi_Vuln_1.png)
And then changing the address of the request
![LoFi Vuln 2](/assets/TryHackMe/Lo-Fi/Lo-Fi_Vuln_2.png)
We are greeted with an interesting message...

## 💥 Exploitation
**Tools Used: Burp Suite**
Now we know the vulnerability to exploit, lets get to work.

Let's start by navigating upwards from our current directory, as we unsure of the exact structure of the target.
Appending "../" to our request goes up one level (out of our current directory)
After moving upwards a few levels, the following gives us what we are looking for:
../../../../../../etc/passwd
![LoFi Exploit 1](/assets/TryHackMe/Lo-Fi/Lo-Fi_Exploit_1.png)

It gives us the contents of the /etc/passwd file
![LoFi Exploit 2](/assets/TryHackMe/Lo-Fi/Lo-Fi_Exploit_2.png)

The description of the TryHackMe box states "find the flag in the root of the filesystem." 
So given that we know the location of /etc/passwd, we can adjust our request to:
../../../../../../flag.txt

And there we have it, the flag!

## 🛡️ Mitigation
After successfully exploiting the system, it's important to consider how to prevent such attacks in a real-world scenario.
To mitigate this vulnerability and prevent similar attacks, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Validate User Input**  
   - Use **whitelisting** instead of blacklisting for file inclusion. Accept only "known good"
2. **Restrict File Access Permissions**  
   - Ensure **sensitive files** (`/etc/passwd`, config files) are not readable by the webserver.
